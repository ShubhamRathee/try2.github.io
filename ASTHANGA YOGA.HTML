            <P>Ashtanga is a dynamic and strong practice linking breath to movement through quick sequences. Prepare to challenge yourself, sweat and tone your entire body.<br>
                <BR>Ashtanga Yoga translates to ‘8 limbed yoga’, referring to the 8 limbs of Yoga.<BR> (1﻿﻿﻿) The 8 limbs of Yoga are guidelines that were intended for yoga practitioners to follow in order to live a more disciplined life.

​<BR>Ashtanga yoga was created by an Indian man called Sri K. Pattabhi Jois<BR> (2) who developed the practice focusing on the 3rd limb of yoga which is asana (pose). He believed that by practising the sequence of postures he developed that the 7 remaining limbs of Yoga would be realised.<br>
There are six series, or sequences, of Ashtanga Yoga progressing greatly in strenuousness. Most practitioners of Ashtanga Yoga will stick with the Primary Series, which is the first and most recognised sequence of Ashtanga Yoga..</P>
