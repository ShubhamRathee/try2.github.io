            <h2>hatha yoga is a catchall term for any type of yoga that pairs poses ("asanas") with breathing techniques ("pranayama")</h2>
            <P>Haṭha yoga is a branch of yoga which uses physical techniques to preserve and channel the vital force or energy. The Sanskrit word हठ haṭha literally means "force," thus alluding to a system of physical techniques.[2][3] Some haṭha yoga style techniques can be traced back at least to the 1st-century CE, in texts such as the Hindu Sanskrit epics and Buddhism's Pali canon.[4] The oldest dated text so far found to describe haṭha yoga, the 11th-century Amṛtasiddhi, comes from a tantric Buddhist milieu.[5] The oldest texts to use the terminology of hatha are also Vajrayana Buddhist.[3] Hindu hatha yoga texts appear from the 11th century onwards..</P>
